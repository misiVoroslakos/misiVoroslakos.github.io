I am a postdoctoral researcher from the [Buzsáki lab](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/) at NYU School of Medicine in New York. Through my multi-disciplinary approach, I acquired first-hand knowledge about the challenges of translational neuroscience. Testing brain stimulation in animals and humans during my MD/PhD has made me aware of the progress needed for TES to become a reliable experimental and therapeutical tool. 
</br ></br >
Currently, non-invasive transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) lacks the desired spatial focality, which limits its effectiveness. In principle, we can target deeper brain structures with precision by harnessing the brain's ongoing state and unique cellular and network features in specific regions.
</br >
My approach combines TES in rodents with large-scale electrophysiology using [Neuropixels](https://elifesciences.org/articles/65859) and [flexible probes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202207576), optogenetics using [μLED](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202105414) and [waveguide probes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-018-0009-2), fiber-photometry, and BOLD-fMRI. 
<br>
<br>
I received my MD and PhD from the University of Szeged in Hungary. The major goal of my PhD research was to better understand the exact mechanisms by which TES could alter ongoing neural activity. 
<br>
I have also spent two years in [Dr. Euisik Yoon’s laboratory](https://yoon.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan to further develop my knowledge in neuroengineering. 
<br>
<br>
I believe in knowledge sharing, and I try to contribute by sharing my [CAD designs](https://github.com/misiVoroslakos/3D_printed_designs) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdvYlo8MudbP35X_S4nmQ-A?app=desktop).
