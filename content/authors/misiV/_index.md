</br ></br > I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Buzsáki lab](https://buzsakilab.com/wp/) at NYU School of Medicine in New York. I combine transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in rodents with large-scale electrophysiology using Neuropixels and flexible probes, optogenetics, fiber-photometry, and BOLD-fMRI. 
<br>
<br>
After completing my medical degree, I started my PhD in neuroscience at the University of Szeged in Hungary. The major goal of my PhD research was to better understand the exact mechanisms by which TES could alter ongoing neural activity. 
<br>
I have also spent two years in [Dr. Euisik Yoon’s laboratory](https://yoon.eecs.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan to further develop my knowledge in neuroengineering. 
<br>
<br>
I believe in knowledge sharing, and I try to contribute by sharing my [CAD designs](https://github.com/misiVoroslakos/3D_printed_designs) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdvYlo8MudbP35X_S4nmQ-A?app=desktop).
