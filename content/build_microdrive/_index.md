### Recoverable metal microdrive
<br />
Metal microdrive for silicon probe recordings. Below are necessary design files and detailed instructions for assembling the microdrives yourself. You may also order them from our production partner 3Dneuro.

![screen reader text](recoverable_microdrive_01.jpg "Figure 1. Recovering a silicon probe")

#### Ordering and assemble the drive yourself
The .step files are optimized for stainless steel 316L, 20 micrometer resolution and aluminum AlSi10Mg, high resolution using Proto Labs (https://www.protolabs.com/). Download step files from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Metal_recoverable).

**In order to receive high quality prints from ProtoLabs, please follow these instructions:**
<br />
Add the following note to drive_v09: “Use orientation as in quote 9301-742”
<br />
Add the following note to arm_v09_aluminum: “Use orientation as in quote 2379-080”
<br />
<br />
For other printers, materials or printing companies, modifications may be necessary.
