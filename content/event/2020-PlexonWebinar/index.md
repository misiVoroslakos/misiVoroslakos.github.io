summary: μLED probes allow researchers to simultaneously perturb neural activity and record electrophysiological signal from the same neurons with high spatial specificity. I outline a procedure detailing all stages of the process for performing reliable μLED experiments in chronically implanted mice.
abstract: Optogenetics are a powerful tool for testing how a neural circuit influences neural activity, cognition, and behavior. Accordingly, the number of studies employing optogenetic perturbation has grown exponentially over the last decade. The recent introduction of μLED silicon probes, which feature independently controllable miniature LEDs embedded at several levels of each of multiple shanks of silicon probes, provides a tractable method for temporally and spatially precise interrogation of neural circuits. Here, we provide a protocol addressing how to perform chronic recordings using μLED probes.
