summary: TES can affect cortical and cortico-subcortical functional networks in anesthetized rats. TES can induce stimulation intensity-dependent changes in prefrontal, default mode, cortico-hippocampal and thalamo-cortical networks.
abstract: Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) is a noninvasive method that can modulate neuronal activity. Despite 20 years of intensive research, the basic mechanisms, and the extent of TES influence on brain functions is still not well understood. To gain a better understanding of the TES effects, we combined neurostimulation with BOLD-fMRI in rats. We have designed an MR-compatible TES setup, including a deuterium-based stimulation electrode system. Our results revealed BOLD responses to TES and altered cortical and cortico-subcortical network responses induced by a variety of stimulation patterns and intensities.
