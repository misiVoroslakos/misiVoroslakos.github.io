title: Circuit Resonance
summary: The term "resonance" denotes the highest level of response exhibited by a neuronal network when subjected to a periodic input limited within a particular frequency range. <br /> The focus of my investigation lies in exploring the potential utilization of intrinsic cellular properties and network mechanisms to enhance the spatial specificity of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS).

Resonance is a notable phenomenon observed in neuronal systems, referring to the peak response of a network to a periodic input within a specific frequency range. Such resonance can manifest at both the cellular and network levels. At the cellular level, spikes may occur in response to specific frequencies of oscillatory input, resulting in what is known as spiking resonance. At the network level, interactions between recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons generate resonant behavior.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) has the potential to modulate network activity through stochastic resonance, neural activity entrainment, or the imposition of specific patterns.

Given that a substantial portion of the extracellularly recorded Local Field Potential (LFP) signal originates from the combined activity of time-overlapping transmembrane potentials, influenced by spike-induced postsynaptic currents (known as synapsembles), any non-physiological alterations in the coordination of neuronal assemblies can be deduced from in-depth analysis of LFP patterns. Although LFP is most commonly used to detect epileptic activity, it can also offer insights into various psychiatric conditions characterized by "oscillopathy" or "rhythmopathy."

The relationship between spike assemblies and synapsembles can also find practical applications in controlling computers, robots, or other artificial actuators. Measuring spatially distributed LFP features offers the advantage of long-term stability compared to multisite recording of single units, which are sensitive to microscopic movements.
