abstract: "Flexible implantable neurointerfaces show great promise in addressing one of the major challenges of implantable neurotechnology, namely the loss of signal connected to unfavorable probe tissue interaction. The authors here show how multilayer polyimide probes allow high-density intracortical recordings to be combined with a reliable long-term stable tissue interface, thereby progressing toward chronic stability of implantable neurotechnology. The probes could record 10–60 single units over 5 months with a consistent peak-to-peak voltage at dimensions that ensure robust handling and insulation longevity. Probes that remain in intimate contact with the signaling tissue over months to years are a game changer for neuroscience and, importantly, open up for broader clinical translation of systems relying on neurotechnology to interface the human brain."
