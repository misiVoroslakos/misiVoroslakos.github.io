abstract: "Evolution of “Michigan Probes” has enabled unraveling the connectivity of neurons at cellular resolution and their dynamic interaction within and across brain areas that underlie behavioral and cognitive functions. Recently, micro-LEDs were monolithically integrated for optogenetic neuromodulation at scale without requiring external optical fiber connection. The ‘hectoSTAR’ micro-LED optoelectrode features 256 recording electrodes and 128 stimulation micro-LEDs in four silicon micro-needle shanks, covering a large volume with 1.3-mm × 0.9-mm cross-sectional area located as deep as 6 mm inside the brain. Technical challenges to overcome in scaling of optogenetic probes will be discussed, followed by future direction."
