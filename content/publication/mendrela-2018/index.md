abstract: "We present a neural interface IC for high-precision optical stimulation and electrical recording from implanted optoelectrodes with the highest system integration to date. The system combines 12 high-resolution constant-current LED driver channels, 32 recording channels, and an efficient PMU for operation from a low voltage Li battery on a wireless platform. A novel LED driver architecture features a high-efficiency wide-current-range fully-integrated voltage regulator and a high-resolution pulse shaper to minimize recording artifacts from sharp current pulse edges. A prototype, fabricated in 0.18$μ$m CMOS, occupies 7.35mm2. The LED driver has a peak efficiency of 50% and consumes 31$μ$W quiescent power. We demonstrate in-vivo that the pulse-shaping scheme prevents stimulation artifacts. Key Words: neural interface, LED driver, optogenetics."
