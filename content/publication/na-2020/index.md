abstract: "The ability to deliver flexible biosensors through the toughest membranes of the central and peripheral nervous system is an important challenge in neuroscience and neural engineering. Bioelectronic devices implanted through dura mater and thick epineurium would ideally create minimal compression and acute damage as they reach the neurons of interest. We demonstrate that a three-dimensional diamond shuttle can be easily made with a vertical support to deliver ultra-compliant polymer microelectrodes (4.5 $Î¼$m thick) in-vivo through dura mater and thick epineurium. The diamond shuttle has 54% less cross-sectional area than an equivalently stiff silicon shuttle, which we simulated will result in a 37% reduction in blood vessel damage. We also discovered that higher frequency oscillation of the shuttle (200 Hz) significantly reduced tissue compression regardless of the insertion speed, while slow speeds also independently reduced tissue compression. Insertion and recording performance are demonstrated in rat and feline models, but the large design space of these tools are suitable for research in a variety of animal models and nervous system targets."
