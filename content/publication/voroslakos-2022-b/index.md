abstract: "Dynamic interactions within and across brain areas underlie behavioral and cognitive functions. To understand the basis of these processes, the activities of distributed local circuits inside the brain of a behaving animal must be synchronously recorded while the inputs to these circuits are precisely manipulated. Even though recent technological advances have enabled such large-scale recording capabilities, the development of the high-spatiotemporal-resolution and large-scale modulation techniques to accompany those recordings has lagged. A novel neural probe is presented in this work that enables simultaneous electrical monitoring and optogenetic manipulation of deep neuronal circuits at large scales with a high spatiotemporal resolution."
